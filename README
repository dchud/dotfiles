dchud's humble little dotfiles.

I lost track of my extensive dotfiles from last
job. That. Will. Never. Happen. Again.

Basic idea, if it isn't obvious: check this out as a project on any host
i do anyting on.  Soft link to the files in the git repo / project dir
from dotfiles in home dir.  Try to remember to commit and push back to
github whenever i make changes.  Live happily ever after.
